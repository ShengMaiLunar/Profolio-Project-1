# King's County Housing Market Analysis 🏡

## Overview
This project analyzes housing prices in King’s County using SQL, R, Python, and Tableau. 

## Summary
I completed a data analytics project showcasing my skills in SQL, R, Python, and Tableau using a housing sales dataset from Kaggle. I extracted and analyzed data with SQL, performing operations such as calculating average prices, identifying flipped houses, analyzing price distributions, and ranking zip codes by property value. In Python, I used Pandas for data manipulation, and in R, I conducted regression analysis and exploratory data visualizations. Finally, I visualized key insights using Tableau, highlighting trends in housing prices, conditions, and other factors affecting sales.

## Key Insights
- The most expensive zip codes are 98039, 98004, and 98040
- Houses with condition 4 and grade 13 have significantly higher prices.
- Majority of houses are prices in between 300K - 400K

## Tools Used
- **SQL**: Extracted and cleaned data.
- **Tableau**: Visualized trends and distributions.
- **R**: Conducted regression analysis, feature engineering, and random forest modeling.
- **Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)**: Complementary data analysis.
