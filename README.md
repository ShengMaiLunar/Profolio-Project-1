# King's County Housing Market Analysis 🏡

## Overview
This project analyzes housing prices in King’s County using SQL, R, Python, and Tableau. 

## Summary
I completed a data analytics project showcasing my skills in SQL, R, Python, and Tableau using a housing sales dataset from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction/data). In the process, SQL were used for the purpose of data exploration, performing operations such as calculating average prices, identifying flipped houses, analyzing price distributions, and ranking zip codes by property value. These key insights were exported into excel files and visualized using Tableau, highlighting trends in housing prices, conditions, and other factors affecting sales. I wish to perform futher in depth analysis at this point, so I moved onto Python and R. In Python, I used Pandas for data manipulation, and in R, I conducted regression analysis and exploratory data visualizations. 

## Key Insights
- The most expensive zip codes are 98039, 98004, and 98040
- Houses with condition 4 and grade 13 have significantly higher prices.
- Majority of houses are prices in between 300K - 400K

## Tools Used
- **SQL**: Extracted and cleaned data, data exploration.
- **Tableau**: Visualized trends and distributions.
- **R**: Conducted regression analysis, feature engineering, and random forest modeling.
- **Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)**: Complementary data analysis.
